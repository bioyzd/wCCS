minor corrections and new section on diff species required in vignette
add figure(s) to vignette
add rationale for TargetScan (Baek etc)
ADD other TgtScan datasets and relevant fucntionality to load these
add makeGeneSet function (and demo in vignette) - currently doing
add overlaps metric function (and demo in vignette)
add KS test capability (see JK project) (and demo in vignette)

CHANGE INTERACTIONS FUNCTION SO IT DOESN'T REPLY ON ONE LIST ELEMENT TO GET SPECIES

LATER
add capability to use other metrics (get data, convert gene ids, run same algorithms and compare outcomes e.g. DianaMicroT ?Pictar, others?)
convert to S3 / S4 i.e. OOP type functions
Compare to CORNA Wu and Mick Watson (! - get related citations in pubmed), see also PMID:19933823, PMID:21125499 (useful review), Wang and Li, “Correlation of Expression Profiles Between microRNAs and mRNA Targets Using NCI-60 Data.”, PMID:22002038, PMID:19517021, PMID:19534746, PMID:19551154 (useful review), PMID:19208133 (time series ? useful for JK work), PMID:22144207, PMID:19295134, PMID:19250313, Using expression profiling data to identify human microRNA targets (Huang et al).


Compare to CORNA (can't do cohort I don't think, but have to test), RmirR, GenMir++, and others useful from the list above.
Filter mRNA by expression level - could this be another selection parameter (papers on mRNA level v miR supression, one from Bartel and one by Mukherji).
