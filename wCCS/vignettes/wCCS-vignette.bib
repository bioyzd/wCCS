	abstract = {We predict regulatory targets of vertebrate {microRNAs} {(miRNAs)} by identifying {mRNAs} with conserved complementarity to the seed (nucleotides 2-7) of the {miRNA.} An overrepresentation of conserved adenosines flanking the seed complementary sites in {mRNAs} indicates that primary sequence determinants can supplement base pairing to specify {miRNA} target recognition. In a four-genome analysis of 3' {UTRs}, approximately 13,000 regulatory relationships were detected above the estimate of false-positive predictions, thereby implicating as {miRNA} targets more than 5300 human genes, which represented 30\% of our gene set. Targeting was also detected in open reading frames. In sum, well over one third of human genes appear to be conserved {miRNA} targets.},

	abstract = {Most metazoan {microRNAs} {(miRNAs)} target many genes for repression, but the nematode lsy-6 {miRNA} is much less proficient. Here we show that the low proficiency of lsy-6 can be recapitulated in {HeLa} cells and that {miR-23}, a mammalian {miRNA}, also has low proficiency in these cells. Reporter results and array data indicate two properties of these {miRNAs} that impart low proficiency: their weak predicted seed-pairing stability {(SPS)} and their high target-site abundance {(TA).} These two properties also explain differential propensities of small interfering {RNAs} {(siRNAs)} to repress unintended targets. Using these insights, we expand the {TargetScan} tool for quantitatively predicting {miRNA} regulation (and {siRNA} off-targeting) to model differential {miRNA} (and {siRNA)} proficiencies, thereby improving prediction performance. We propose that {siRNAs} designed to have both weaker {SPS} and higher {TA} will have fewer off-targets without compromised on-target activity.},

	abstract = {{MicroRNAs} are endogenous approximately 23-nucleotide {RNAs} that can pair to sites in the messenger {RNAs} of protein-coding genes to downregulate the expression from these messages. {MicroRNAs} are known to influence the evolution and stability of many {mRNAs}, but their global impact on protein output had not been examined. Here we use quantitative mass spectrometry to measure the response of thousands of proteins after introducing {microRNAs} into cultured cells and after deleting mir-223 in mouse neutrophils. The identities of the responsive proteins indicate that targeting is primarily through seed-matched sites located within favourable predicted contexts in 3' untranslated regions. Hundreds of genes were directly repressed, albeit each to a modest degree, by individual {microRNAs.} Although some targets were repressed without detectable changes in {mRNA} levels, those translationally repressed by more than a third also displayed detectable {mRNA} destabilization, and, for the more highly repressed targets, {mRNA} destabilization usually comprised the major component of repression. The impact of {microRNAs} on the proteome indicated that for most interactions {microRNAs} act as rheostats to make fine-scale adjustments to protein output.},

	abstract = {Animal {microRNAs} {(miRNAs)} regulate gene expression by inhibiting translation and/or by inducing degradation of target messenger {RNAs.} It is unknown how much translational control is exerted by {miRNAs} on a genome-wide scale. We used a new proteomic approach to measure changes in synthesis of several thousand proteins in response to {miRNA} transfection or endogenous {miRNA} knockdown. In parallel, we quantified {mRNA} levels using microarrays. Here we show that a single {miRNA} can repress the production of hundreds of proteins, but that this repression is typically relatively mild. A number of known features of the {miRNA-binding} site such as the seed sequence also govern repression of human protein synthesis, and we report additional target sequence characteristics. We demonstrate that, in addition to downregulating {mRNA} levels, {miRNAs} also directly repress translation of hundreds of genes. Finally, our data suggest that a {miRNA} can, by direct or indirect effects, tune protein synthesis from thousands of genes.},

	abstract = {Mammalian {microRNAs} {(miRNAs)} pair to {3'UTRs} of {mRNAs} to direct their posttranscriptional repression. Important for target recognition are approximately 7 nt sites that match the seed region of the {miRNA.} However, these seed matches are not always sufficient for repression, indicating that other characteristics help specify targeting. By combining computational and experimental approaches, we uncovered five general features of site context that boost site efficacy: {AU-rich} nucleotide composition near the site, proximity to sites for coexpressed {miRNAs} (which leads to cooperative action), proximity to residues pairing to {miRNA} nucleotides 13-16, positioning within the {3'UTR} at least 15 nt from the stop codon, and positioning away from the center of long {UTRs.} A model combining these context determinants quantitatively predicts site performance both for exogenously added {miRNAs} and for endogenous {miRNA-message} interactions. Because it predicts site efficacy without recourse to evolutionary conservation, the model also identifies effective nonconserved sites and {siRNA} off-targets.},
